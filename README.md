<h2>About me</h2>

I am Varnika Singh, currently working as a Software Developer [LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin). I am very keen to learn new technologies and use them to either create something useful or improve the existing softwares.   
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to connect with people and learn about their journey, it helps me to open up my mind for different perspectives on various domains.   
ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I will be more than happy to help :D
